## 🧠 Thought Process

> *“A portfolio should not just be a site. It should reflect your clarity, confidence, and creativity.”*

While building this site, I kept recruiters in mind. Here's what I focused on:

- **Readability & Flow:** I prioritized simplicity and scannability over flashiness.
- **Highlighting Projects with Purpose:** Each project has a clear description and tech stack so that hiring managers get context without needing to ask.
- **Minimal Dependencies:** I kept it lightweight and framework-free to ensure fast load times and maximum compatibility.
